# Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition trends using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization**. The goal is to understand the factors affecting employee turnover and provide insights to HR teams for better decision-making.

## 🔥 Objectives
- Identify key reasons behind employee attrition.
- Analyze demographic, performance, and salary-related trends.
- Create interactive visualizations to communicate insights.
- Use **Python, SQL, and data visualization tools** for analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Data Processing**: SQL (for querying attrition data)
- **Visualization**: Power BI / Tableau / Matplotlib
- **Dataset**: HR Employee Attrition Dataset (CSV/Excel)

## 📊 Key Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Employee tenure vs. attrition rate
   - Department-wise attrition
   - Salary vs. attrition trends
   - Work-life balance impact
3. **SQL Queries**:
   - Attrition rate per department
   - Average salary of employees leaving vs. staying
   - Performance rating and attrition correlation
4. **Visualizations**:
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis
   - Bar charts for department-wise attrition
   - Pie charts for categorical distributions

## 📂 Dataset Description
| Column Name       | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| EmployeeID       | Unique ID for each employee |
| Age             | Age of the employee |
| Department      | Department where the employee works |
| MonthlyIncome   | Employee's salary |
| JobSatisfaction | Satisfaction rating (1-5) |
| Attrition       | Whether the employee left (Yes/No) |

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-attrition-analysis.git
   cd employee-attrition-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Load and analyze the dataset:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('employee_attrition.csv')
   df.head()
   ```
4. Run EDA and visualize insights.

## 📢 Future Enhancements
- Create an interactive Power BI / Tableau dashboard.
- Perform advanced SQL queries for deeper insights.
- Add machine learning predictions (optional).

## 💡 Conclusion
This project provides a **data-driven approach** to understanding employee attrition. By analyzing key factors, HR teams can take proactive measures to improve **employee retention and job satisfaction**.
